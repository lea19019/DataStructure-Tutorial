# Data Structure Tutorial

Welcome to the Data Structure Tutorial. In a world with an everyday increasing data growth, the following will help us manage all this data:

* [Queue](1-queue.md)
* [Set](2-set.md)
* [Tree](3-tree.md)

Each module will contain descriptions and examples.  At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own.  You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
